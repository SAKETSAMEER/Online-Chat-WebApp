# Online Chat Web Application

This is an online chat web application built with the [Flet](https://github.com/Flet/Flet) framework. It allows users to join a chat room, send and receive messages, and interact with others in real-time.

## Features

- User-friendly chat interface.
- Ability to set your display name when joining the chat.
- Real-time chat updates and message notifications.
- Easy-to-use message input with support for text, emojis, and more.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAKETSAMEER/Online-Chat-WebApp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Online-Chat-WebApp
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install flet
```

4. Run the web application:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Access the chat in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8550`.

## How It Works

- The application uses the Flet framework to create an interactive web-based chat interface.
- Users can join the chat by providing a display name and start sending and receiving messages in real-time.
- Messages are displayed as chat bubbles, and new messages are appended to the chat window as they arrive.
